# The-Tacoma-Narrows-Bridge

## Tacoma Narrow Bridge Accident
The 1940 Tacoma Narrows Bridge, the first Tacoma Narrows Bridge, was a suspension bridge in the U.S. state of
Washington that spanned the Tacoma Narrows strait of Puget Sound between Tacoma and the Kitsap Peninsula. It
opened to traffic on July 1, 1940, and dramatically collapsed into Puget Sound on November 7 of the same year. The
Tacoma Narrows Bridge was built to replace an aging ferry system that connected the city of Tacoma with the Kitsap
Peninsula. The bridge was designed by renowned engineer Leon Moisseiff, who also designed the Manhattan Bridge
in New York City. The Tacoma Narrows Bridge was an innovative design for its time, with a relatively narrow deck
and a suspension system that utilized thinner cables than previous suspension bridges.
However, just a few months after it opened, the bridge's deck began to oscillate and twist in the wind, leading to its
eventual collapse. The disaster was a major setback for the engineering community and raised questions about the
safety of suspension bridges. In the years that followed, new techniques were developed to better understand and
account for the effects of wind on structures.
The collapse of the bridge, which was captured on film, was a major engineering disaster and led to new design and
construction methods for suspension bridges. The cause of the collapse was attributed to a phenomenon known as
aeroelastic flutter, which occurs when wind causes a structure to vibrate and oscillate at its natural frequency. The
bridge's design and construction, as well as the failure to account for the effects of wind, were major factors in the
disaster.
The Tacoma Narrows Bridge collapse was a major event in the history of engineering and helped to advance
understanding of the effects of wind on structures.
